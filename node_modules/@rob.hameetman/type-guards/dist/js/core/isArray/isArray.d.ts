 * Requirements:
 *   - `value` must be an instance of {@link Array}.
 *
 * @typeParam T - [Optional] The type of data the array contains. Defaults to `unknown`.
 *
 * @param value - An `unknown` value.
 * @param isT() - [Optional] An additional type-guard to check whether the values in the array are of type `T`.
 *
 * @returns The determination that `value` is or is not an {@link Array} of type `T`.
