## ¬ß1: Overview

This is a test package used for testing the [@rob.hameetman/semantic-release-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rob.hameetman/semantic-release-config)
package. It is used in a Docker container, which checks out this repo and then
copies the latest build artifact into `node_modules/`.

## ¬ß3: Publishing

Creating and merging PRs will create new package versions that you can monitor
by vising the _Actions_ tab in Github.

### Channels

- `alpha`: Used for manual testing in other packages
- `beta`: Used for UAT and testing by external consumers
- `next`: Everything that will be included in the next major version release
- `pr-*`: Used for testing individual PRs

### Versioning

This project uses [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions
available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/RobHameetman/test-package/tags).

Major versions should have a corresponding release in Github. Click
[here](https://github.com/RobHameetman/test-package/releases/new) to create a
new release once your version meets acceptance criteria.

A pre-release version will be published whenever you create a PR and incremented
as you update your changes. Once the PR is merged, a release version is created
automatically. This is handled with `semantic-release`. The versioning for your
PR has the following format by default

```Plaintext
<PR_PRERELEASE_TYPE>.<PR_NUMBER>.<COMMIT_SHA_SHORT>.<DATE_HASH>
```

By default, the `PR_PRERELEASE_TYPE` is `pr`, which yields something like the
following:

```Plaintext
v1.0.1-pr.1.b9e76bf8.20240728
```

This would be released to the channel `pr-1`, allowing you to install the latest
changes by running `npm i @rob.hameetman/test-package@pr-1`.

You can change the pre-release type by setting the `RELEASE_PR_PRERELEASE_TYPE`
environment variable. The entire pre-release ID and channel name can be changed
by setting `RELEASE_PR_PRERELEASE_PREID` and `PR_PRERELEASE_CHANNEL`
respectively.
